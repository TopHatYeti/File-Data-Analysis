# File-Data-Analysis
Python Project using File I/O Exception handling and Object-Oriented Programming that allows a user to select from uploaded data files and perform statistical analysis on it.

The program is coded in python and I used pyCharm IDE. The program allows a user to select from a menu which dataset they want to perform statistical analysis on. It'll then ask which data column they want to analyze, and produce a histogram of the data column as well as statistical values of the data column. AFter it's finished with analysis, the user can select a different column or dataset.
